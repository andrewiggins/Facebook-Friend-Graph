Facebook Friend Graph
=====================

---

Overview
========

The purpose of this package is to generate a [GraphML][2] file
which can be used to make graphs like the ones created by following the 
directions outlined in a [presentation][1] by Sociomantic Labs titled 
*Facebook Network Analysis*.

This software produces a file comparable to the one the **Netvizz** Facebook 
app (referenced in the [presentation][1]) would provide. So if you follow the 
[presentation][1] directions starting with "1. Gephi: Open", replacing 
the `.gdf` file from *Netvizz* with the `.graphml` file this software generates, 
you will get a graph like the one in the [presentation][1].
